## Part 2: Design and Implementation of a Knowledge-based Solution

### Problem Selection and Justification
- **Problem Selection:** Wumpus World
- **Justification:** The Wumpus World is an excellent choice for a knowledge-based solution. It is inherently rule-based, aligning with the strengths of rule-based systems.

### Design
1. **Explanation of The Problem in Knowledge Representation Terms**
   - Entities, Attributes, Relationships

2. **Schematic Representation of The Solution**
   - Figures illustrating successful exploration and agent's evolving understanding.

3. **Explanation of The System Design**
   - Rule-based system design and rationale for chosen rules.
   - Handling Uncertainty, Dynamic Adaptation, Verification, and Debugging.

### Implementation
1. **System Architecture:**
   - Input Perceptions
   - Inference Engine
   - Knowledge Base

2. **Python Implementation of Wumpus World:**
   - Overview
   - Description
   - Python Code
   - Quick Demo
